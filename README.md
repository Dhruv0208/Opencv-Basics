# Opencv-Basics
Going through all the basic of OpenCV and practicing. Have been following tutorials from FreeCodeCamp.org <br />
The folder <a href="https://github.com/Dhruv0208/Opencv-Basics/tree/main/Face%20Recognition">Face Recognition</a> consist of the implementation of the OpenCV built in recognizer on faces detection of different celebrities. Although the results were quite weird as the labels of the celebrities were wrong, sometimes with confidence level of more than 100%. Stating that the OpenCV built in recognizer is not a perfect recognizer and also the dataset we used to train the recognizer was small which also should be one of the reasons of weird results.
